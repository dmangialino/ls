-A	List all entries except for . and ..

-a	Include directory entires whose names being with a dot (.) 

-d	Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively)

-F	Display a slash (‘/) immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an 		asterisk (‘*’) after each that is an
    executable, an at sign (‘@‘) after each 		symbolic link, an equals sign (‘=‘) after each socket, a percent sign (‘%’) 
    after 	each whiteout, and a vertical bar (‘|’) after each that is a FIFO.	

-i	For each file, print the file’s file serial number (node number).

-l	List in long format.

-m	Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by commas.

-n	Display user and group IDs numerically, rather than converting to a user or group 	name in a long (-l) output. 

-p	Write a slash (‘/‘) after each filename if that file is a directory.
